  content: "“The best moments in our lives, are not the passive, receptive, relaxing
    times—although such experiences can also be enjoyable, if we have worked hard
    to attain them. The best moments usually occur when a person’s body or mind is
    stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult
    and worthwhile.\n\nOptimal experience is thus something that we make happen. For
    a child, it could be placing with trembling fingers the last block on a tower
    she has built, higher than any she has built so far; for a swimmer, it could be
    trying to beat his own record; for a violinist, mastering an intricate musical
    passage. For each person there are thousands of opportunities, challenges to expand
    ourselves.”  \n― **Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi**"
