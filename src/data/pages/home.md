    Hi, I’m Sarah – I follow my curiosity and do my best to integrate and apply what I learn in pursuit of wisdom and wonder.

    My background and professional experience are rooted in psychology and human development, but I have a wide range of interests and feel most alive when I’m helping others imagine what’s possible and how.

    It’s kind of tough to get to know someone from a little blurb, so here are two ways to get more context…
