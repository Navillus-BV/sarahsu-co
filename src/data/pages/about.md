  content: |-
    My superpower is navigating the "space between" (e.g. ideas, people, behaviors, stages) and co-creating magic in the process.

    Life happens at the edges - between what we know and what we don't, between where we are and where we want to be.

    I help curious and creative people like you find their own unique ways to navigate these spaces and get where they want to go in the process.
